## Description

I ran this binary somewhere that contains crucial files, and suddenly, all of them were encrypted. Could you help me recover them?

**Important** : Execute this binary only in a test directory with test files that you're okay with them getting encrypted. Otherwise, you'll need to solve the challenge before you'll be able to recover your files


## Solution

Solution of the challenge can be found [here](solution/).
