  > Last week was a really tough one, so a reset was required. I want to a friend (which took around 3 hours, but was a really overpriced) in another country. We met at the train station, then we passed the street in the first image (1), we ordered a takeaway at a Halal restaurant, then we set at a place which had several public benches (images 2_1, 2_2, 2_3).
  > Funnily enough, the city name resembles the name of a character in a famous Video Game.
